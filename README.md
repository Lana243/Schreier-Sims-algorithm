# Schreier-Sims-algorithm
The project is dedicated to Scheier-Sims algorithm. This module:
1. Implements class of permutations.
2. Builds Schreier Tree by generators and the element.
3. Implements full chain of stabilizers class.
4. Allows to check whether the stabilizers' chain is full.
5. Allows to check whether group contains the element.

This module allows to solve different calculations.
For example:
1. Calculate the number of different solutions of the Rubik's cube for the robot.
2. Calculate the number of configurations that can be created from started in Pyramorphix.
3. Calculate the number of different card mixes (look at main.py).
